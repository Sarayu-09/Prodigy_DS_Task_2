Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involves:

Handling missing values
Addressing outliers
Ensuring data consistency
Performing any necessary transformations or preprocessing steps
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The exploratory data analysis process includes:

Descriptive statistics
Visualization of distributions and relationships between variables
Identification of patterns and trends in the data
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the Jupyter Notebooks data_cleaning.ipynb and eda.ipynb to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, respectively.
Modify the code and analysis as needed for your specific dataset and objectives.
